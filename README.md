# MOT Test Data Application
Advanced Programming Assignment

Assignment Brief:

In this assessment, you are going to create a desktop Java application capable of browsing the MOT
test data you have downloaded and performing some basic statistical analysis. Because the data is
fairly sizeable (approx 3GB), you will import it into an SQLite database to allow the data to be
searched efficiently. You will need to submit an exported (.zip) eclipse project containing the
following:

  1. The source code of a JAVA program that imports all of the CSV data you downloaded
     into an SQLite database using JDBC. The database itself will be too large for submission, so
     be sure not to include that in your exported work.
  2. The source code of a Java desktop application that allows users to query the created
     database using JDBC to view specific test results and identify trends.
  3. Some screenshots depicting the results of specified queries in your application.
